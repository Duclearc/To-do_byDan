**<h1>To-Do byDan</h1>**
A simple localStorage to-do app. With all the expected functionalities of:
- creating a new to-do.
- marking a to-do as 'complete'.
- having completed items moved to a 'done' list.
- deleting to-do items.
- using the local storage as a simple way for data-permanence.
- responsive design, that adapts to the screen size.

This was a very simple but fun project, done as part of an afternoon of testing the Bulma CSS framework.
